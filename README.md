### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Joined Github {{ ACCOUNT_AGE }} years ago.

Since then I pushed {{ COMMITS }} commits, opened {{ ISSUES }} issues, submitted {{ PULL_REQUESTS }} pull requests, received {{ STARS }} stars across {{ REPOSITORIES }} personal projects and contributed to {{ REPOSITORIES_CONTRIBUTED_TO }} public repositories.

Most used languages across my projects:
